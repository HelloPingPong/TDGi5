Key Highlights of the Current Implementation
The Test Data Generator is a robust Java application designed to generate test data for document variables in Quadient Inspire and Designer. The code demonstrates several well-implemented features:

A flexible data generation framework with a plugin-like architecture for data types
Comprehensive REST APIs for template management, data generation, scheduling, and PDF analysis
A sophisticated scheduling system using Quartz for both one-time and recurring generation jobs
Batch processing capability with both sequential and parallel execution options
PDF analysis functionality that can extract variables from redline documents
Multiple output formats (CSV, JSON, XML) with proper escaping and formatting

Architecture Strengths
The application follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

Controllers handle HTTP requests and delegate to services
Services contain the core business logic
Repositories manage data access
DTOs facilitate API communication
Entities represent the persistence model
Custom exceptions provide meaningful error handling

Continuation Points
For AI assistants or developers continuing work on this project, here are the key points to focus on:

Data Generator Expansion: Add more generator types following the established pattern. The AbstractDataGenerator and DataGeneratorType annotation make this straightforward.
Frontend Development: Begin implementing the React/TypeScript frontend according to the structure in Project Structure.txt. The API endpoints are already well-defined.
PDF Analysis Enhancement: Improve the variable detection in PDFAnalysisService, particularly for complex documents.
Database Migration: When ready, implement the migration from H2 to PostgreSQL.

Code Standards and Patterns
When continuing development:

Follow the established naming conventions and package structure
Maintain the existing error handling approach with custom exceptions
Use the @Transactional annotation for database operations
Continue with the comprehensive logging pattern
Preserve the DTO/Entity separation pattern

Extension Recommendations
The modular design allows for several natural extensions:

Implement integration with document management systems
Add data visualization capabilities for generated data
Create import/export functionality for templates
Develop template versioning and history tracking
